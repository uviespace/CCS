# CcsUvie
UVIE CCS configured for CoCa

Find the original repository here: https://gitlab.phaidra.org/mecinam2/CCS.git

## Installation
Please check the original installation steps.

Following you can find the steps used to install CCS on **Ubuntu**.

- git clone repository
- sudo apt install make
- sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev
- sudo apt install libgtksourceview-3.0-1
- install pip https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/
- sudo apt install python3.10-venv
- sudo apt-get install python3-dev
- sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
- sudo apt install python3-gi python3-gi-cairo gir1.2-gtk-3.0 gir1.2-gtksource-3.0
- sudo apt install python-dbus-dev
- in contrast to the readme, I use my already installed mysql version (instead of using mariadb)
  * login to mysql (e.g. sudo mysql -u root)
  * CREATE USER 'ccs'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Aik4eeya';
  * GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'ccs'@'localhost';
  * FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  * exit;
- python3 -m venv ./venv --system-site-packages
- source ./venv/bin/activate
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- configure database section in egse.cfg file:
  * line 14: user = ccs
  * line 16: password = Aik4eeya
  * also have a look into the paths, especially line 5 obsw
  * change line 11: COMETINTERCEPTOR
- make confignator
- make databases
- setup database with following steps:
  * change line 17 in egse.cfs to real mib-schema (e.g. mib_schema_coca)
  * import a set of SCOS2000 MIB files (e.g. ./Ccs/tools/import_mib.py './CoCa/mib_tables/mib_dat_exports/' 'mib_schema_coca' 'ccs')
  * ./Ccs/tools/import_mib.py 'path_to_MIB_file_directory' 'mib-schema-from-line-17-egse.cfs' 'db_user'
  * script will then ask for db password
- start CCS: ./start_ccs
- start TST: ./start_tst

## MIB Table Schema
The mib table import script uses the file [Ccs/tools/scos2000db.json](Ccs/tools/scos2000db.json)

If the project does not use the normal SCOS2000 schema, a change of
this file may be required.

## Scripting
The CCS Editor can be started with `./start_css`.

Within this editor scrips can be created / run. The default script
`connection_setup.py` implements a basic connection setup.

```python
# Basic connection setup to IASW sim via PLM SW sim

### Poolmanager ###
cfl.start_pmgr()

# PLM connection
cfl.connect('LIVE', '', 5570, protocol='PUS')
cfl.connect_tc('LIVE', '', 5571, protocol='PUS')

### Poolviewer ###
cfl.start_pv()

#! CCS.BREAKPOINT
### Monitor ###
cfl.start_monitor('LIVE')
```
It will do:

- starts the poolmanager
- creates an up and down connection (to localhost port 5570/5571)
- starts the poolviewer
- starts the monitor

(The script is stored under [Ccs/scripts](Ccs/scripts). The
`pool_name` is `LIVE`.)

If there is a need to **stop a running scipt** (e.g. a script sending telecommands in an endless loop) this can be done with CTRL+SHIFT+C.

For tests, you can find a **dummy socket client** under
[CoCa/test_scripts/dummy_socket.py](CoCa/test_scripts/dummy_socket.py)
it will just print out all binary commands sent to it.

## Troubleshooting

### Add Additional Logs to CCS Log Window

CCS runs in different processes, to add additional logs to the CCS log
window (tab in the CCS Editor). Add following lines:

```python
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(level=logging.DEBUG)
logging.warning('...')
```

### Change Default Log Level

To enable more extensive logging, set the `level` option in
[Ccs/ccs_main_config.cfg](Ccs/ccs_main_config.cfg)

[comment]: # (discussion on github https://github.com/mmecina/CCS/issues/4#issuecomment-1922284468)

```ini
[ccs-logging]
log-dir = ${paths:base}/logs
level = DEBUG
max_logs = 30
```

### Make Exceptions Visible
If there is an exception in a process running in the background, the process fails but the user does not notice it. In order to investigate such problems, one can run the process not as a stand-alone process, but in the CCS Editor terminal. For instance, if one suspects an error in the Poolviewer, one can start it from the CCS Editor by executing

```python
cfl.start_pv(console=True)
```

In this way, unhandled exceptions will be seen in the CCS console. 

### Use of the Python Debugger
If there is a need to run the python debugger, most modules can also be run by executing the respective Python files directly which allows the debugger to be accessed normally. Examples of modules which can be started in this way include:
- The PoolViewer is started by running `./Ccs/poolview_sql.py`
- The TestSpecificationTool is started by running `./Tst/tst/tst.py`
